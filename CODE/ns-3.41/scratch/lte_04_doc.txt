This is an NS-3 script written in C++ that simulates a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network with two User Equipment (UE) nodes, one eNodeB (base station), and one remote host. The script sets up a network topology, configures the LTE devices, and runs a simulation to demonstrate the communication between the UEs and the remote host.

Here is a breakdown of the script:

Includes and namespace

The script includes various NS-3 headers, such as core-module.h, network-module.h, internet-module.h, mobility-module.h, lte-module.h, flow-monitor-module.h, and applications-module.h. The using namespace ns3; directive allows the script to use NS-3 classes and functions without qualifying them with the ns3:: prefix.

Main function

The main function is the entry point of the script. It initializes the simulation, sets up the network topology, configures the LTE devices, and runs the simulation.

1. LOG START

The script enables logging for the "LteSimulation" component and sets the log level to INFO.

2. LTE and EPC helpers initialization

The script creates instances of LteHelper and PointToPointEpcHelper to assist with setting up the LTE network and Evolved Packet Core (EPC) components.

3. Node containers setup

The script creates three node containers: ueNodes for the two UEs, enbNodes for the eNodeB, and remoteHostContainer for the remote host.

4. Internet stack for the remote host

The script installs the Internet stack on the remote host node using the InternetStackHelper class.

5. Point-to-point link configuration

The script sets up a point-to-point link between the eNodeB and the remote host using the PointToPointHelper class. It configures the data rate, delay, and IP addressing for the link.

6. Set up the mobility model

The script sets up the mobility model for the eNodeB and UEs using the MobilityHelper class. The eNodeB is fixed at a specific position, while the UEs are configured to move randomly within a certain area.

7. Install LTE devices

The script installs LTE devices on the eNodeB and UEs using the LteHelper class.

8. Set up a UDP application

The script sets up a UDP echo server on one of the UEs and a UDP echo client on the remote host. The client sends packets to the server, which responds with echo messages.

9. Set up another UDP application

The script sets up another UDP echo server on one of the UEs and a UDP echo client on the other UE. The client sends packets to the server, which responds with echo messages.

10. Enable tracing

The script enables tracing for the LTE devices and sets up a flow monitor to collect statistics.

11. NetAnim animator setup

The script sets up a NetAnim animator to visualize the simulation. It configures the node descriptions, images, and colors for the UEs, eNodeB, and remote host.

12. Run the simulation

The script runs the simulation for 10 seconds using the Simulator::Run() function.

13. Flow monitor statistics output

The script serializes the flow monitor statistics to an XML file.

14. Destroy the simulation

The script destroys the simulation using the Simulator::Destroy() function.
