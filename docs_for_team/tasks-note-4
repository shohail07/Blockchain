	2. hyperledger-fabric
	3. blockchain-explorer

	4. ns3 simulation data live collect
	5. stage-4 data collection job -> 
	
	# link 5 and 6
	# data has to available - node server application using express, react
	
	6. data has to be available to our fabric network - using fabric SDK, Gateway SDK
	7. chaincode implementation
	8. blockchain verification
	
	- identity check user1,2,3
	- data check
	- user1 data -> create block
	- user2 recieve -> data copy that been sent from user1
	- user 2 data -> create block
	- orderer user1 and user2 block crossmatch
	- data from user1 sent to user2
	
	comparison	- table -	
	
	4G LTE - data transfer and server save - 60
	 fabric - 80

	==========
	
	user_1 text message -> user_2 recieved
	

	if the text message is changed/altered/breach	in between the transaction while reaching to user_2

	===========
	
	network LTE/4G - network is being used by all users.
	user 4 is trying to change/read the text message that has been stored in the network/server
